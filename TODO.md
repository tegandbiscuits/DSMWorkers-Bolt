* Figure the maximum for images, and use that instead of 1000x1000
* Projects list should maintain 264x200 or another more common aspect ratio
* Listing needs paginaiton
* Move sass to sass dir
* Make images with float in page use js to use percentages (at least at small sizes)
* Possibly use js to add caption from alt text
* Make viewport be the size
* page.twig should have if record image as well
* Make the title more descriptive
* Do if statements for blocks
