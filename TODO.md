* Projects list should maintain 264x200 or another more common aspect ratio
* 404 page that says 'A spectre is haunting Des Moines. But that spectre is not here.'
* Writing for the radical worker, and aims excerpt should be a block
	* aims excerpt should also have a link to full aims
* Listing needs paginaiton
* Move sass to sass dir
