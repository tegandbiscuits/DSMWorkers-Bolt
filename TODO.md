#TODO

* Set maximum widths for things that are not full width
	* (~1200px probably)
* Change px to em
* Possibly change menu css to use flexbox
* Figure the maximum for images, and use that instead of 1000x1000
* Projects list should maintain 264x200 or another more common aspect ratio
* Fonts need to be embedded
* Projects list on index images and name need to be links too
* Set one of the font families as the default font
* Get footer social icons
* Make footer link not linky
