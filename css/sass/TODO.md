#TODO

* Set maximum widths for things that are not full width
	* (~1200px probably)
* Change px to em
* Possibly change menu css to use flexbox
* Figure the maximum for images, and use that instead of 1000x1000
* Projects list should maintain 264x200 or another more common aspect ratio
* Image next to aims needs to pushed down a bit
	* This could also could be a normal image
* Fonts need to be embedded
* Variables should go in their own scss file
* Projects list on index images and name need to be links too
